# CO2-Emission-Analysis-and-Prediction

This study forecasts global carbon dioxide emissions from 1887 to 1975 using regression models and original numerical data from various countries. The findings indicate that China, the United States, and India are the top 3 CO2 emitting nations worldwide. There are declining trends in the emissions of carbon dioxide in Thailand, Chile, Singapore, and Japan. Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States are the countries that have experienced the fastest increase. Since the United States, in particular, has maintained a very quick growth rate with a large base of carbon dioxide emissions, a significant amount of pressure will be placed on the global response to climatic and environmental concerns. Malaysia, Russia, Peru, Canada, South Korea, Chile, and Singapore all have very stable CO2 emission levels. One of the few encouraging signs is the clear decline in CO2 emissions in Japan. To put it simply, excessive carbon dioxide emissions are a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. It is commonly known that the greenhouse effect has a lot of negative effects, including an increase in pests and diseases, a rise in sea level, an environment that is too warm, an increase in ocean storms, and a worsening of desertification. Therefore, countries should pay closer attention to carbon dioxide emissions regardless of whether they are rising or falling, modify their energy and climate policies accordingly, and cooperate to address the issues related to climate change.

Results Obtained:

CO2 emission share for each contributor is shown below. The highest emission is by coals. We can predict that this must be the thermal industry that uses coal to generate electricity emits the maximum amount of CO2.
